# Question Suggestion in Klyra AI

## What is Question Suggestion?

Question suggestion is an AI-powered feature that automatically generates **relevant follow-up questions** after each chatbot response. It helps users discover what else they might want to know about their skincare concerns.

## Why Question Suggestions?

## How It Works

### **Smart Context Analysis**
